## üîç **Introduction to GPTBot**
`GPTBot` is OpenAI‚Äôs web crawler (`User-Agent: GPTBot/1.2`) used for data collection.  
**Offensive testers can abuse this** to:  
‚úÖ Test **bot detection** mechanisms.  
‚úÖ Bypass **WAFs** (Web Application Firewalls).  
‚úÖ Identify **misconfigured servers** leaking data to crawlers.  

**Evidence**:  
- OpenAI confirms `GPTBot`‚Äôs existence ([source](https://openai.com/blog/gptbot)).  
- Many sites block bots like `GPTBot` (e.g., [Cloudflare Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-bot-management/)).
